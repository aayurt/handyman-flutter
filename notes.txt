<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION"/>


    // This is probably the only one you need. Background location is supported
// by this -- the caveat is that a blue badge is shown in the status bar
// when the app is using location service while in the background.
NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription

// Deprecated, use NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription instead.
NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription

// Use this very carefully. This key is required only if your iOS app
// uses APIs that access the userâ€™s location information at all times,
// even if the app isn't running.
